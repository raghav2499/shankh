### Branching and Commit Guidelines

Syntax to be followed for forking out new branches:
- `{JIRAId}/{Parentbranch}/{Your name or Feature or any custom tag}`
- Example situation: New branch from master for fixing a bug with JIRA ID ORG-123
  Suggestive branch: `ORG-123/master/customTag`

### Commit Syntax
- All commit messages should have a JIRA ID in them.
- It's also advised to put the reason for making the change in the message.
- Adding your name in the message will help you identify your commit (e.g., in Jenkins changes page).
- Preferred separator in the message is `|`
- Example: `git commit -m "ORG-123|Raghav|Making this commit to provide an example for the syntax that can be followed"`

#### Deployment Guidelines
